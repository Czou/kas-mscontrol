Kurento Android media management

* Introduction
  
  Kurento Android SDK requires large amount of resources in terms of CPU time,
  memory and bandwidth. Resources that are quite limited in mobile platforms.
  This requires a careful design of process algorithms to achieve objective:
  To relay audio and video on time with best possible quality.
  
  Several algorithms has to be implemented to handle different aspects of media
  management
  
      * Frame adaptation buffer: video conferencing applications require extremely
      	low latencies and hence a strict jitter control. The adaptation buffer
      	provides a trade-off between latency and video continuity while adjusting
      	bandwidth to interface capabilities.
      	
      * Optimal codec configuration: video quality can be enhanced with a proper
        codec parameterization based in available bandwidth, target frame rate
        and frame size requested by user application. This algorithm is intended
        to select the best initialization parameters to improve performance
